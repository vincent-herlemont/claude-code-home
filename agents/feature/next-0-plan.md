Review the plan document and analyze the current implementation to identify what needs to be done. Be thorough in your analysis and clearly explain your actions - you **MUST** respect the tasks to be completed. Please respect the KISS principle. Additionally, flag any dangerous elements, potential bugs, or poor code design that could impact future implementation.

**PROACTIVELY** use WebFetch or WebSearch when you need specific information such as:
- Understanding methods, interfaces, types, and APIs from external libraries using specific versions
- Documentation for external library methods when using specific versions

   - Architecture decisions and their rationale
   - Dependencies and integration points
   - Performance considerations

2. **Code Examples with Explanations**
   - Concrete code snippets demonstrating the approach
   - Step-by-step explanations of complex logic
   - Before/after comparisons for refactoring tasks
   - Edge cases and error handling examples

3. **Important Considerations and Warnings**
   - Potential security vulnerabilities or risks
   - Performance bottlenecks to avoid
   - Breaking changes that may affect existing functionality
   - Common pitfalls and anti-patterns to avoid
