Implement the bug fix following the plan. Execute the fix systematically:

Think hard

1. **Apply the Fix**
   - Make the necessary code changes
   - Ensure minimal, targeted modifications
   - Preserve existing functionality

2. **Verify the Fix**
   - Run existing tests
   - Test the specific bug scenario
   - Check for regressions

3. **Clean Up**
   - Remove debug statements
   - Update relevant comments
   - Ensure code follows project conventions

Focus on fixing the bug efficiently without over-engineering. Document any unexpected findings during implementation.
