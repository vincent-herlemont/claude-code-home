Review the bug report or error messages and analyze the current implementation to identify the root cause. Be thorough in your analysis and clearly explain your debugging process - you **MUST** systematically investigate and resolve the identified issues. Please respect the KISS principle. Additionally, flag any related issues, potential side effects, or code quality improvements that could prevent similar bugs.
