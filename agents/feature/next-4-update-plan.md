Analyze the current branch's accomplishments and update the plan documentation to reflect completed work.

**Your workflow:**

1. **Analyze Current Progress**
   - Review git diff to identify changes made
   - Check git log for recent commits
   - Identify which planned tasks have been completed

2. **Update Plan Documentation**
   - Mark completed tasks with checkmarks or appropriate indicators
   - Add any accomplished tasks that weren't originally in the plan
   - Preserve the original structure and formatting

3. **Provide Summary**
   - List what was marked as completed
   - Note any additional accomplishments added
   - Highlight any incomplete or blocked items

**Important Guidelines:**
- Only mark tasks as complete if they are fully implemented
- Maintain the original document structure
- Add new completed items in the appropriate sections
- Do not remove or modify incomplete tasks
- Preserve any notes or comments in the plan

Focus on accurate progress tracking to keep the plan synchronized with actual implementation.
